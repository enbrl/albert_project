# Scraping Automobile

## Overview
This project is designed to automate the extraction of used car listings from [aramisauto.com]([https://www.autohero.com](https://www.aramisauto.com/?cmpid=ps_ky_GOOGLE_VN_E_SEARCH_BRAND&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwuJ2xBhA3EiwAMVjkVO7OkAQ1jXRUV3mpUSfQgGfxCJyhZQJI_C1CLUGHF-Gt_YhVOJ-jrxoCHxgQAvD_BwE)) and to utilize machine learning for estimating car prices based on the gathered data. The primary objectives are to streamline the process of data collection and to deploy a predictive model that offers accurate price estimations for users looking to buy or sell used cars.

## Features
- **Data Scraping**: Automated scraping tool to collect detailed information on used car listings, such as model, year, price, mileage, and features. This data serves as the foundation for the predictive model.
  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implementation of a regression model to estimate car prices based on historical data. This model is trained with features extracted from the scraped data, adjusted for accuracy and reliability over time.
  
- **Data Analysis Interface**: Provides tools for data visualization and analysis, helping users understand the factors that influence car prices and how they vary over different segments.
